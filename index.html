        <article id="realRules" class="realGameRules">
            <h2>"Paper and pen" game version</h2>
            <p>The game has no age limit and can be played from 2 to 10 persons.
                Every player had to make his own game card by drawing on the notebook page a table. The first row
                contain catogories choosen by participants. Common categories are: country, city, animal, thing, plant,
                name, car, and total points.</p>
            <p>Every turn start by saing loudly by one person x, y, z and then in slience he is going thru by alphabet
                letters. Person next to him has to say stop to choose letter. When the first person say the letter loud
                - game turn start. Everybody needs to write word for each category started by the chosen letter.</p>
            <p>Person who finish first, start loudly count from 0 to 30, when he finish counting everybody stop writing.
            </p>
            <p>Now everyone share words for each category and writing the points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If everyone has the word in category:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 points: for players who has the same word</li>
                    <li>10 points: for players who has different words</li>
                </ul>
                <li>If someone has no word in some category:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>0 points: for the player who has empty</li>
                    <li>10 points: for players who has the same words</li>
                    <li>15 points: for player who has different word than others.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Everybody sum the points, write in total column and next round start. Person who was saying stop is
                saying x, y, z now. If he was stopped on the same letter, then he start again from x, y, z.</p>
